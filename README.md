This is a project implementing cells from the thalamocortical network model of Traub et al 2005 in NeuroML. 

Based on the NEURON implementation from: http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.asp?model=45539.

See http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/thalamocortical for more details.

This project was contributed to by [Rokas Stanislovas](https://github.com/RokasSt) as part of the [2016 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#53374629015715840). He worked on the conversion and testing of cell models to NeuroML2 and the creation of Python scripts to generate versions of the column. See [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Thalamocortical/tree/master/NeuroML2) for more details.
